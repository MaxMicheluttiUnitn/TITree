# $\color{turquoise}{TURQUOISE}$  $\color{indigo}{INDIGO}$  $\color{white}{TREE}$

I will tell you a story.

Once upon a time there was a daltonic computer scientist who was working on a brand new data structure. His dream was to change once and for all the unoptimized and euristic binary tree into something more powerful, more flexible, more efficient, but still with the same base concept. Many before him had tried and all had failed, but he was determined to change the world and couldn't be stopped by anything. He knew he needed help, and luckily he knew exactly who to ask.

There is only one being in the whole universe that can help data scientists achieve their dreams and it is the majestic astral being Bein Hari, a being who could use its powers to create entire data centres in seconds and whose mind could solve any instance of SAT in polytime. This majestic being can only be reached by humans through a spiritual connection while they do programming.

The data scientist embarked on a journey to find Bein Hari. He opened his laptop and started writing lines of all programming languages he knew, from C to Java, from Python to Haskell, every known language was written, compiled and executed in a way that it was never been before and finally Bein Hari manifested itself to the computer scientist.

"Bein Heri, is that you?" the scientist asked.
But Bein Hari knew that the connection between him and humans is weak and lost no time in presentations.

"4 rules", the majestic beign said.

- "In Darkness the root shall be, and no light shall ever touch it"

- "In Darkness also the leaves, and NIL their name be"

- "Only Darkness and Light may touch its children, and their children recursively. And Light shall never generate Light."

- "From root to leaf darkness shall exist N times. And for all leaves shall N be the same."

"Look at the see and Light and Darkness will be"

After saying these words the astral being disappeared and the computer scientist never saw it again in his life. The computer scientist, now prophet of this trascendental knowledge, folowed the rules spoken and developed a data structure so powerful that only HashTables could be fairly compared to it. 

This data structure was, and still is, elegant, quick and merciless. A power to behold, a wonder in the hand of all humans to handle, a small gift by the gods that humanity will always be thankful.

Once the work was done the computer scientist was only left with the task of naming his creation. So he followed the last line that Bein Hari said and he went to the sea. There he understoood everything: he saw the sea had Light and Dark spots just as the being told him about light and darkness.

And so he decided to name his structure as the colors of those spots: Red Black Tree.

So bad that, unluckily, the computer scientist was daltonic and he was unable to distinguish colors. The real colors he saw were Turquoise and Indigo, but his slight sight disability made him perceive the wrong colors.

And so, after all these years, it is now time to complete the work that the computer scientist started and, in his honour, complete the task that Bein Hari gave him, by giving the correct colors to the data structure.

This is the $\color{turquoise}{TURQUOISE}$ $\color{indigo}{INDIGO}$  $\color{white}{TREE}$.
